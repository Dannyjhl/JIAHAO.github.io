üíºInternship Experience
---
In 2023, I interned at KEMU Technology in Suzhou, maintaining a high-traffic database (30M+ entries, 20K+ daily visits) and developing a viral restaurant mini-program with 32K daily users.

In 2024, I joined <span style="color: #e63946;">AMD</span> in Shanghai as a software intern, where I built a real-time face-swapping system using FFmpeg, object detection, and <span style="color: #e63946;">RyzenAI</span>. I replaced CPU-bound OpenCV processing with custom GPU shaders and optimized asynchronous CPU-GPU execution to sustain 20 FPS.

üî¨ Research
---
I am currently conducting research under the supervision of Prof. Ren√©e Sieber on the project Data Rescue: Archives & Weather, in partnership with CEIMIA. Our work aims to uncover weather-related vulnerabilities by analyzing both past and present disruptive weather events, leveraging digitized historical newspapers as a primary data source. This involves applying techniques in:

<span style="color: #e63946;">Natural Language Processing (NLP)</span>

<span style="color: #e63946;">Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</span>

<span style="color: #e63946;">Prompt Engineering</span>

<span style="color: #e63946;">Large Language Model (LLM) Training</span>

<span style="color: #e63946;">High-throughput I/O Optimization for Document Processing Pipelines</span>



üöÄ Projects
---
At [McHacks 11](https://devpost.com/software/box-my-professor), I built [Box My Professor](https://github.com/s026352/MCHACKS11), a gamified AI demo that won the ‚ÄúAchievement Unlocked‚Äù award. I implemented <span style="color: #e63946;">real-time gesture control</span> with MediaPipe, created 3D avatars from images using AI + Unity, and added interactive features like punch physics, music, and score tracking.

With the [McGill Robotics](https://mcgillrobotics.com/) Team, I develop software for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). My work focuses on <span style="color: #e63946;">control logic</span> and <span style="color: #e63946;">sensor integration</span>, enabling the robot to navigate underwater using visual and acoustic cues.

üéØ Research Interests
---
I'm passionate about applying generative AI and computational methods to address complex, real-world challenges. My research interests lie in information retrieval and natural language processing, with a focus on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-agent collaboration.

 I'm also deeply interested in visual perception and navigation in robotics as well as optimizing AI models for GPU acceleration, bridging the gap between deep learning and high-performance computing.
