In 2023, I interned at KEMU Technology in Suzhou, where I helped maintain a high-traffic database supporting over 30 million entries and 20,000+ daily visits. I also developed a viral restaurant exploration mini-program that attracted over 300 TikTok influencers and reached 32,000 daily users.

Afterward in 2024, I joined AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) in Shanghai as a software intern, where I worked on real-time video AI applications. I developed a GPU-accelerated face-swapping system that combined object detection with FFmpeg and RyzenAI. This involved replacing CPU-bound OpenCV processing with custom shaders, optimizing performance to maintain 20 FPS through asynchronous CPU-GPU execution.

🔬 Research
======
I am currently conducting research under the supervision of Prof. [Renée Sieber](https://rose.geog.mcgill.ca/) on the project Data Rescue: Archives & Weather, in partnership with CEIMIA. Our work aims to uncover weather-related vulnerabilities by analyzing both past and present disruptive weather events, leveraging digitized historical newspapers as a primary data source. This involves applying techniques in NLP, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), prompt engineering, large language model (LLM) training, and tackling I/O challenges inherent in large-scale document processing pipelines.

🚀 Projects
======
At McHacks 11, I built Box My Professor, a gamified AI demo that won the “Achievement Unlocked” award. I implemented real-time gesture control with MediaPipe, created 3D avatars from images using AI + Unity, and added interactive features like punch physics, music, and score tracking.

With the McGill Robotics Team, I develop software for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). My work focuses on control logic and sensor integration, enabling the robot to navigate underwater using visual and acoustic cues.
